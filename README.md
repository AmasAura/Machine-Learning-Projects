# Machine-Learning-Projects
is repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects** I have worked on.   Each project demonstrates different ML techniques (classification, regression, predictive analytics) and follows a clear structure with well-documented Jupyter Notebooks.    The goal is to showcase my ability to clean data, build models, evaluate performance.
