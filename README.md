# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects** I have worked on.  
Each project demonstrates different ML techniques (classification, regression, predictive analytics) and follows a clear structure with well-documented Jupyter Notebooks.  

The goal is to showcase my ability to clean data, build models, evaluate performance, and present insights in a professional way.
